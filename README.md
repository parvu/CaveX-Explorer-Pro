# CaveX Explorer Pro

A cave-exploration robot dashboard: a React/Express web frontend, and a ROS 2
Jazzy / Gazebo Harmonic simulation stack (`ros2_ws/`). Design rationale,
verification results, and historical notes live in `launch.txt`, not here —
this file is build/run instructions only.

## Web frontend

Requires Node.js.

```bash
npm install
```

Optional: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY` to enable the
AI ROS 2 assistant panel; falls back to an offline template generator without
a key.

```bash
npm run dev      # dev server (Vite + Express) on http://localhost:3000
# or, for a production build:
npm run build
npm start         # http://localhost:3000
```

## ROS 2 / Gazebo simulation stack

Requires ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic, plus `rtabmap_ros`, `nav2_bringup`,
`ros_gz_sim`, `ros_gz_bridge`, `xacro`, `robot_state_publisher`, `tf2_ros`,
`python3-numpy`, and `libgtsam-dev` (see each package's `package.xml`).

```bash
cd ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
source ardupilot_gazebo_env.sh   # ArduPilot SITL env, incl. mavproxy.py on PATH
```

Package quick reference — see `launch.txt` for full launch sequences, driving
commands, and verification steps for each:

| Package | What |
|---|---|
| `cavex_slam_nav` | Original wheeled robot, RTAB-Map SLAM, ATE eval |
| `cavex_tracked_vehicle` | Tracked BlueBoat + BlueROV2, ArduPilot Rover/Sub SITL |
| `cavex_sonar` | Simulated BlueROV2 acoustic sonar + ocean current |
| `cavex_perception` | RGB-D + lidar instance clustering |
| `cavex_sic_slam` | Real GTSAM Sonar-Inertial-Current factor-graph SLAM |
| `cavex_dcs` | Drift/Current Suppression controller (feed-forward + PI) |
